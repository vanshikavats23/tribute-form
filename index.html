          <h2>Hollywood Star and Inventor</h2>
          <p id="about-info">
            Heddy Lamarr was a renowed Austro-Hungarian-born American Hollywood
            star, famous for her roles in "Samson and Delilah" (1949) and
            Tortilla Flat (1942), during the Golden Age of movie making. As a
            beauty icon, she captured many hearts with her phenomenal acting
            skills, being the first to ever display love scenes in their
            entirety.

            But beyond acting, she was also an inventor, and had a great passion
            for creating and finding solutions. She is most famously known for
            her invention of the “frequency hopping”, alognside George Antheil,
            which pioneered the technology used for the creation of Wi-Fi,
            Bluetooth, and GPS. Though often not as highly accredited for this
            invention, today, we recognize both her beauty and brillance.
